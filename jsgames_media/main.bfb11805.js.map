Starting anchor, then control point 1, control point 2, and ending anchor, then the next control point 1, control point 2, anchor, etc. Uses less memory than an array with a bunch of {x, y} points.\n - Bezier - a single cubic Bezier with a starting anchor, two control points, and an ending anchor.\n - the variable \"t\" is typically the position along an individual Bezier path (time) and it's NOT linear, meaning it could accelerate/decelerate based on the control points whereas the \"p\" or \"progress\" value is linearly mapped to the whole path, so it shouldn't really accelerate/decelerate based on control points.
